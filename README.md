# SMD Reflow oven

I converted an old bread machine into a reflow oven. I replaced the original
control board with a STM32F103 bluepill board, a 2 chanel relay board as well
as a type k thermocouple.  The components for the conversion coast around 10â‚¬
in total and it should be possible to apply them to most bread machines,
electric BBQs, raclette grills etc.
